### About MusicTimeMachine

Have you ever find an article with some top songs? E.g. from some decade that you would like to listen, but adding so much songs to playlist is annoying and lengthy 🫣
Now, this program will help you!

This program works with website <a href="https://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100/">Billboard.com/charts/hot-100</a> where you can find TOP 100 songs of particular date! Not just year.

The program will need you to login to your Spotify profile and then it will take an input from you - desired date 📆 and automatically make a new playlist of all the songs that are available on Spotify - in your Spotify profile. 
That´s it! You can start to listening!
